    % In this chapter, we will go through, in more details, the main problems in this thesis, structure of this thesis and the contributions made. At the start, we will provide major drawn backs into the current algorithms in the literature. After this, we will show the current development control-as-inference in single agent domains, which can be extends to multi-agent domain, showing possible profits from resolving the stated problem. Finally, we will expand the whole layout of this thesis.
    In this chapter, we will investigate the problems posted and trying to capture the main theme is this thesis in more details. We will start by giving a brief overview of control as inference framework, and maximum entropy multi-agent reinforcement learning (MEMARL) and provides some of the algorithms in the family. Furthermore, we will show some of the developments of both frameworks (and their problem), and other related algorithms that will be used in our work\footnote{We will simply talk about what these algorithms do but we refers mainly to chapter \ref{chapter:chap2} and other chapters for more thorough treatment.}. Finally, we expand the whole layout of this thesis going, in details, the content of each chapter.
