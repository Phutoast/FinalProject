    In this chapter, we investigate the problems posted and trying to present the overview of this thesis in more details. We will start by giving a brief overview of control as inference framework/maximum entropy multi-agent reinforcement learning (MEMARL) and provides some examples of the algorithms in the family. Then, we show some of the extensions of this framework to multi-agent problem, and the problem that is arised from doing so\footnote{We will talk about what these algorithms do, but we refer mainly to chapter \ref{chapter:chap2} and other chapters for a more thorough treatment.}. Finally, we describe the whole layout of this thesis by going through the content of each chapter, in detail.
